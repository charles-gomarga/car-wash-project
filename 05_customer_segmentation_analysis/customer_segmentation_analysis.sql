--Query 1: Total Customer per Plan

--Purpose: Calculate the number of active customers under each subscription plan and their proportion relative to the total active customer population.
--SQL features: Common Table Expression (CTE), COUNT(DISTINCT), INNER JOIN, ROUND(), and Window Function (SUM() OVER()).

WITH total_cust_per_plan AS(
	SELECT
		plan_name,
		COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customer --Count unique active customers per plan.
	FROM subscription s
	JOIN plan p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
	WHERE is_active=1 --Consider only active subscriptions
	GROUP BY p.plan_id, plan_name
)

SELECT
	plan_name,
	total_customer,
	ROUND(total_customer/SUM(total_customer) OVER()*100, 2) || '%' AS ratio -- Calculate the percentage ratio of customers on each plan.
FROM total_cust_per_plan

--Query 2: Visit Frequency Segmentation

--Purpose: Segment customers by visit frequency relative to the maximum allowed visits based on their subscription plan.
--Logic:
	--Low: less than 25% of max allowed visits
	--Medium: between 25%â€“50%
	--High: more than 50%
--Note:
	--Segments visits at the vehicle level.
	--Plan visit caps are normalized (Diamond = 30 visits/month).
	--Only active subscriptions are considered.

--SQL features: Common Table Expression (CTE), CASE WHEN, COUNT(), and GROUP BY.

-- Normalize visit limits (Diamond plan = 30 visits)
WITH normalized_max_visit AS(
	SELECT
		plan_id,
		CASE WHEN plan_id=4 THEN 30 ELSE max_visit_per_month END AS max_visit

--Query 3: Total Visit for Multi-vehicle Customers.

--Purpose: Track how frequently each vehicle is used by customers who own more than one vehicle, focusing only on visits within the past 30 days.
--SQL features: Common Table Expression (CTE), COUNT(), GROUP BY, INNER JOIN, HAVING, and INTERVAL

-- Identify customers who own more than one vehicle
WITH multi_vehicle AS(
	SELECT customer_id FROM vehicle
	GROUP BY customer_id
	HAVING COUNT(vehicle_id)>1

--Query 4: Behavioral Drift Detection

--Purpose: Detects sudden behavioral changes in customer engagement based on their visit activity compared to the previous month.
--Classification Rules:
	--Safe: Activity stayed the same or increased.
	--Low Churn Risk: Visit drop less than 50%.
	--High Churn Risk: Visit drop of 50% or more.

--SQL features: Common Table Expression (CTE), DATE_TRUNC(), COALESCE(), CASE WHEN, ROUND(), and COUNT(DISTINCT)

--Query 5: Downgrade Behavior

--Purpose: Detects customers who downgraded their subscription plan within the past 6 months.
--Notes:
	--Higher plan_id = higher plan tier (e.g., Diamond = 4, Gold = 2, etc.)
